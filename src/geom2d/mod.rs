//! 2D curve algebra.
//!
//! This layer answers the questions the rest of the kernel asks constantly:
//! where do two curves meet, what does this loop offset to, is this point
//! inside, which fragments chain into a closed boundary. Editing commands
//! sit directly on it, and the B-rep layer reaches down into it whenever it
//! has to work in a face's parameter space.
//!
//! Everything here obeys the coordinate policy in [`frame`].
