//! The shapes a face sits on and an edge runs along.
//!
//! Topology says which face borders which; geometry says where they are. The
//! two are kept apart because they change independently — a boolean rewrites
//! adjacency while leaving every surface exactly as it was, and a face can be
//! moved without any coedge noticing.
//!
//! # Analytic first, spline last
//!
//! A cylinder is stored as a cylinder, not as a spline that happens to look
//! like one. That is not an optimisation: an ACIS file says `cone`, and
//! lowering it back as a B-spline surface loses the fact that it was ever
//! round — every downstream consumer, including the next modeller to open
//! the file, then sees an approximation. The analytic cases are also the ones
//! whose intersections have closed forms, which is the difference between a
//! boolean that lands on the exact circle two cylinders share and one that
//! lands near it.
//!
//! Surfaces this layer does not model yet are not lost either: a face lifted
//! from a file and left alone lowers back as its own record. See
