//! The step between finding the intersection curves and deciding what to
//! keep. Afterwards, every face of either solid is wholly inside the other or
//! wholly outside it — never partly both — so classifying a piece is one
//! question with one answer instead of a face that would have to be described
//! as "inside over here".
//!
//! Both solids are imprinted, not one. A union has to keep the outer part of
//! *each*, so each needs the other's curves cut into it.
//!
//! # Why it can fail, and why that is reported
//!
//! A face pair whose intersection has no closed form, a pair of coincident
//! faces, a cut this kernel cannot make: each leaves the imprint incomplete
//! in a way the caller cannot see by looking at the result. A boolean run on
//! a half-imprinted body produces a solid — one with a wall missing. So the
//! failures are returned, and a boolean refuses on them.
